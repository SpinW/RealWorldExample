# Real world example for SpinW 

Presentation about setting a model for 
Pr(Ca<sub>0.9</sub>Sr<sub>0.1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a half-doped bilayer manganite.
We use the Goodenough model of charge ordered antiferromagnetism, with the theory (as pertaining to this
material) described in the paper by 
[G.E. Johnstone et al., <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> <b>109</b> 237202](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7108).
